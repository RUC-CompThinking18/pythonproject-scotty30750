This is a great step up from the previous code review: you've done a great deal of work since we last spoke, and it seems like it would run if there weren't some encoding errors that were keeping it from actually running. Let's talk in person about ways to simplify this code: right now, you're typing the same thing over and over again. That's what a function is for, so let's figure out a way to prevent you from typing that and inviting error. Otherwise, good work here.
