1-The material in my quiz is thoughtful and interesting I can say with full confidence; the health of Earth's ocean is something that is highly important to Earth's well-being and for mankind's well-being in the future. My goal was to make my quiz interactive as well as informative that way it could make the learning experience hands on and furthermore have my program do an overall exceptional job at teaching about ocean pollution. The discovery I've made throughout this course and more specifically during this project is that programming can teach in ways that can be highly useful.
2-My inspiration for making this was because I see firsthand working down the shore how bad pollution is and how drastically it's impacting oceanic environments. It's something that I feel people either ignore or just simply don't care about. The problem is that the pollution is going to sneak up on mankind and it's going to bring with it devastating consequences that perhaps can't be fixed. As miniscule as it is and if it only stops one person from littering, at least my quiz will have made some kind of impact. In only a short amount of time compared to Earth's full history, mankind as a whole has polluted Earth's oceans at epic rates of speed. If continued, mankind will self-destruct. Therefore, when creating this project I thought about how useful an ocean pollution quiz that provides factual information would be in informing the general public how serious this problem is. It's a problem that's so threatening, if not stopped then life as we know it on Earth will crumble and burn to ash. For me, it was a no brainer making some kind of program that would inform people about what is going on with our oceans. Furthermore, our oceans are pivotal to mankind's survival; without them life cannot exist. This one would think be enough of a reason to stop polluting-- but this isn't the case. People still pollute left and right, perhaps at a lesser rate then say 100 years ago but still people pollute despite knowing the consequences. This quiz is my personal attempt to bring into the light and inform people about ocean pollution and furthermore getting them to take action. Perhaps they'll think twice before they throw their soda can over the side of a boat. If only one person takes my quiz and it encourages them not to pollute then I did my job.
3-When thinking about the best way to accomplish this goal on informing people about the serious subject of ocean pollution I certainly did encounter some problems when writing my code. First off I wanted to make my quiz interactive and at the same time inform the quiz taker. It took me some time to figure out raw input function and how it worked, but after going over chapter 14 in the textbook I had no issues. Another problem that I ran into was how exactly I was going to set up my quiz. I had it set that I wanted to inform the quiz taker as well as have them interact so the best way I ended up coming with this was asking for their input first, then whether they were right or wrong I would print a fact after the feedback of whether or not they were right or wrong. It sounds simple but figuring out how exactly I was going to set this up took me awhile. I did achieve my goal; going into greater depths only strengthens the message of my quiz and the quiz taking experience. It did take me a lot of time as well as trial and error to get everything where I wanted it; with that being said the bigger picture is the importance of preventing ocean pollution and the first step in achieving this is by informing. I feel confident that my quiz brings into the light the nastiness of ocean pollution and that it will change some people's minds and for that I feel as though my goal has been reached. In this process I have learned a TON about programming; essentially I had zero prior knowledge. Being able to plug ideas into a program to teach, learn, and make communication easier is the main idea that I personally have taken away from the process of this project.
