Unfortunately, your code didn't run due to the encoding error we discussed in class.

# Comments
You had some good line-by-line comments throughout that gave a sense of what individual pieces did and why. I would have liked to have seen more comments about the flow of the program as a whole and a sense of how the pieces fit together.

# Code quality
You managed to fit a lot of material into this project, and the experience of actually running it was informative while feeling conversational. You didn't manage to create a function that could ask the questions for you, so the code isn't very DRY, but it does run all the way through without error.

# Ambition
This project does well in this category: you took an important issue and made an interesting interactive experience about it. Your passion for the project showed through, and I'm glad you were able to use it as a learning opportunity.
